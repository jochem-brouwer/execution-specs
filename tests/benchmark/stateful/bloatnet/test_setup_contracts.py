    Deploy the contracts behind the `AccountMode.EXISTING_CONTRACT_*`
    receivers via the deterministic CREATE2 factory.

    Runs once as a global setup before the bloatnet benchmarks; the
    transactions intentionally carry no test phase so that the payload
    pipeline replays them ahead of every scenario. Each deployment's
    gas limit is computed from its cost, then transactions are packed
    into blocks up to the block gas budget.

    After the contracts, deterministic EOAs are delegated via EIP-7702 to the
    EXISTING_CONTRACT_DIFF receivers (delegate ``i`` -> ``i``-th DIFF
    contract). The delegations are part of this setup so that, by the time the
    benchmarks run, the delegated authorities already exist in the chain's
    prestate; the client under test does not create them during the measured
    run and therefore cannot warm/cache them. Benchmarks target these accounts
    by deriving them; see ``helpers.diff_delegate_authority`` /
    ``diff_delegate_target``.
